a piece of letter

To My Dearest,

I wish you were here. My thoughts have been a constant echo of you lately, lingering on what we had—and what we lost. I long to sit with you and speak my heart, as I once did. Perhaps if you were here, my restless mind would find a moment of peace. I've been struggling to move on. Perhaps, because you were the only one who ever truly saw me. 

You don't know the silent battles I've fought to keep from reaching out. So here I am once more, writing a letter that will never find its way to you. My soul can't cease its yearning for you. I will not tire of waiting, even if a decade must pass. I began loving you at 16, and now, at 19, that love has never faded. Through those years, I learned to wait—even when I had no certainty that you would ever return. 

My prayers have become a quiet plea. Each prayer holds a place for you. I pray for your safety and for your happiness. We both know we fought for us, that we both cared. But some battles we cannot win, not against the will of God. After months of silence, I gathered the fragments of my heart—I chose you. But fate had a different plan; you had found another. Oh, how I begged the heavens to spare me, for I had traded my faith for a boy.

My tears will scream your name. You consume my every waking thought. I must end this letter now, for my mind has no more words to give. This ache remains, and I fear I will carry it for the rest of my life.
